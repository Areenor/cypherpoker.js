# CypherPoker.JS

CypherPoker.JS is an open source implementation of peer to peer cryptographic poker, or Mental Poker, written in JavaScript.

It makes extensive use of cutting-edge [browser technologies](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/) and desktop ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) / [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)) runtime environments.

CypherPoker.JS is written by [the same author](https://github.com/monicanagent/) as the [original ActionScript CypherPoker project](https://github.com/monicanagent/cypherpoker) and employs many of the same features including the SRA cryptosystem and game / peer protocols as [described in the original wiki](https://github.com/monicanagent/cypherpoker/wiki).
